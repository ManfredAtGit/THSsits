In September 2023, we went for our first sit in Switzerland. In Chatillion at Lac Neufchatel where we very welcomed by our hosts Saloua and Pascal.
We had a beautiful home with spacious living room and kitchen and a terrace with gorgious views over the Lake.

We had to care for 2 pets: Neo a 3 year old black tom cat (very independent and sel contained) and Eko a 5 year golden retriever.
Both are quite lovable and affectionate. As most golden retriever Eko can be strong minded - that's makes two of us ;-)
